Welcome to Sing Along !!
<br>
It is a command line based application to scrap lyrics from 'lyricsgram' and 'Gaana.com' websites and put them into '.txt' or '.src' file (Choice will be asked during execution)
<br>
Both English version (i.e. http://www.lyricsgram.com/...) and Hindi version (i.e. http://hindi.lyricsgram.com/...) of Lyricsgram are supported.
<br>

There are two ways to do so -

1. By directly putting link into command line interface.
2. By giving multiple links through _'links.txt'_ file of _'/Lyrics_links'_ path of current working directory. In link.txt file each single line contains only one link.

All the lyrics will be saved with their name as in the website. The default folder is _'Lyrics_data'_ in currenrt working directory.
